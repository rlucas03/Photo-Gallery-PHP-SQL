Images/ Photo Gallery Web Application using MYSQL and PHP. By Ryan Lucas, August 2018

You can upload a valid photo with a title and description. Mime type is checked to ensure file has valid photo extension, e.g, .jpg. Photo is also resized while maintaining aspect ratio. 

Installation:

Change settings in includes/config file to match your environment credentials
    change the database credentials to match your db

Create MYSQL Database, use the tablecreation.sql file that i have provided in the sql folder of the application

3. Make sure to set the right permission, usually 777 on the images folder so you can (write, read, execute) on the server.
